# Machine Learning
A bunch of examples I made when learning Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
Feel free to use it for whatever you want.

## Preparations

- Install a [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) manager on your PC.
- Prepare a [Kaggle API](https://www.kaggle.com/settings) token and place it here: `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`

## Installation
<!-- Update requirements: conda list -e > requirements.txt -->

- Clone this repository and navigate to it within your shell.
- Add Conda Forge channel: `conda config --add channels conda-forge`
- Prepare a Conda environment: `conda create --name ml --file requirements.txt`
- Activate it: `conda activate ml`
